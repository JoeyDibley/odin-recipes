    <h1>Mac N Cheese</h1>
    <img src="../img/mac_n_cheese.jpeg" alt="macaroni and cheese">
    <p>Macaroni and Cheese, Mac for short, is a simplistic twist on a typical Italian dish.
        It was first introduced to the U.S. and the U.K. in the 1700's, but the recipe spread even more during the two world wars.
        Since then it's become a staple on kid's menus and a popular side dish for family get-togethers.
